  <p>A badminton rally starts with the serve. Master a proper serving will give you an edge over your opponent right from the start of the rally. In this situation, this will not create a chance for your opponent to execute an attacking shot. Therefore, it is important to know how to serve properly so that you will not lose a point after making a service.</p>
  <br>
  <p>There are two methods of learning a badminton serve which are high serve and low serve. </p>
  <br>
  <h1>The High Badminton Serve</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This serve generally executed when you want the shuttle to land at the back end of the court. A decent high serve must have the shuttle dropping sharply downwards at the back end of the court. Learning high serve can avoid your opponent from performing a strong smash. In its place, a lob or a drop is more expected from your enemy. The high serve is beneficial against opponents who cannot perform strong smashes from the back of the court.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Try to serve the shuttlecock to your opponent’s backhand area. The aim is to force your opponent to use his backhand. This is because most badminton players, even world class player, have weaker backhands (compared to their forehands). </p>
    <p>An example is shown in the picture below.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
        <p>Let me show you how to do a high serve…</p>
        <br>
        <img  src="styles/serving2.jpg" alt="high serve" >
        <br>
            <p>1. Grasp the head of the shuttlecock with its head fronting downwards so that the shuttlecock will drop straight down. (Picture is shown above)</p>
            <p>2. Relax your racquet arm (arm that is holding the racquet) and Stand sideways (the side of your body facing the net).</p>
            <p>3. Let go of the shuttlecock and swing your racquet arm upwards. As you do this, twist your waist to the extent that your body faces the net. Flick your wrist towards the direction you want the shuttle to land (Flick your wrist upwards, so that the shuttlecock will fly high).</p>
            <p>4.Your back leg should lift up naturally (with your toes touching the ground).</p>
            <br>

  <h1>The Low Badminton Serve</h1>
    <br>
    <p> When you want the shuttlecock to land in front of the court (in front of your opponent), low serve is the choice you should use. A <b>GOOD</b> low serve will have the shuttlecock flying <b>JUST ABOVE THE NET</b> to prevent your opponent get a chance to dash forward and smash the shuttle down to you. It will prevent your opponent from making an offensive shot if you executed a perfect low serve. An example is show in the picture below.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="styles/serving3.jpg" alt="high serve" >
    <br>
    <p>Let me show you how to do a low serve…</p>
    <p>I. Hold the feather of the shuttlecock with the head of the shuttlecock facing downwards. (Picture is show above)</p>
    <p>II.  Position the racquet behind the shuttlecock.</p>
    <p>III. If you are right handed (left handed), step slightly forward with your right (left) leg.</p>
    <p>IV.  Flick your racquet lightly while pushing your thumb forward towards the direction you want the shuttle to land after letting go of the shuttlecock. The power comes mainly from the push of your thumb and the slight flick of your wrist.</p>
    <br>

  <h1>The Flick Serve (“Fake” Low Serve)</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The “fake” low badminton serve can also be used to trick your opponent (deceive your opponent to expect a low serve).<p>
    <br>
    <p>When you stand in a low serve position, your enemy would probably expect a low serve. However, push your thumb and flick your wrist harder so the shuttlecock flies HIGH and heads to the back of the court!</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>In short, this technique can be applied for every player in court and it can be learnt by everyone.</p>
